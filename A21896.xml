            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt Maiſties pleaſure is, vpon her vnderſtanding of the great diſorders heretofore and eſpecially the Laſt Lent committed in killing and eating fleſh in the time of Lent, eſpecially in the Citie of London, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereto adioyning, that the ſtatute made in the fiſt yeere of her Maieſties reigne for the reſtraint thereof, be put in due execution by the way of inquiſition, and charge of Iuries, and by any other good meanes, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Citie and all other places requſite within the Realme.</p>
            <p>And for the better knowledge of the trueth of theſe diſorders, and redreſſe of the inconueniencess, the ſayd Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhall call before them, and ſend for any of the ſeruants of any Inholders, Victuallers, Tauernrrs, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of ordinarie tables, and ſuch other that utter victuals, to examine them vpon their corporall othes, what fleſh ſhall be, or is any day during the Lent ſeaſon dreſſed, killed, vttered, or eaten in their houſes: which if they ſhall refuſe to doe, then they ſhall commit to priſon the ſayd ſeruants, ſo refuſing vpon their othes to declare the trueth.</p>
            <p>And Becauſe a great part of this diſorder groweth by the Butchers of the Citie of London, and alſo of the Countrey, that ſecretly kill and bring fleſh to the Citie: there ſhall be onely ſixe Butchers licenced by the Lord Maior to kill fleſh within the ſayd Citie and liberties thereof, yeelding for the reliefe of maymed Souldiers and Mariners ſuch ſummes as ſhall he limitted for that purpoſe by order of the privie Counſell.</p>
            <p>And euery of theſe Butchers to be ſo licenced, ſhall be firſt bound in the ſumme of two hundreth poundes to her Maieſties vſe, (and the bonds to the certified to the Queenes Remembrancer in the Exchequer) to ſell no fleſh in the time of Lent, but to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as ſhall ſhew them ſpeciall warrant from the Lord Maior, vnder his hand, and that the Butchers doe truely keepe particular bookes of their dayly ſales, and of the names of thoſe to whome they ſhall ſo ſell, with the quantities and the times thereof.</p>
            <p>That the Lord Maior giue order to theſe Butchers, not to ſell any fleſh but at reaſonable prices, &amp; for that purpoſe the prices ſhall be ſet downe by the ſayd L. Maior, ſuch as may be reaſonable both for the buyer and ſeller: and if the Butcher ſhall breake that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then to be foorthwith diſcharged, and committed to priſon, and an other put into his place, and his bond to be certified into the exchequer to the Queenes benefice.</p>
            <p>That the Lord Maior himſelfe ſhall graunt no warrant for buying of fleſh in Lent, but to ſuch as ſhall haue and ſhewe to him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in good writing according to the lawes of the Realme to eate fleſh, and the ſaid licence to be viewed and regiſtred, firſt by ſome two meete perſons to be appointed for this purpoſe by the Lorde Maior, and Bookes to be kept thereof, to be ſhewed further when the ſame ſhall be required, vnleſſe it be to Ambaſſadors and Agents of forreine Princes, to whome notwithſtanding no further quantitie ſhall be allowed, then ratably for their owne houſbold, and that ſuch Ambaſſadors and Agents ſhall giue to the Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior a Certificate weekely, what they ſhall require to be for their owne tables.</p>
            <p>That the L. Maior ſhall nowe preſently before Lent cauſe all Inholders, Table keepers, Victualers, Alehouſekeepers, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners within the Citie, and liberties thereof, to appeare before him, or ſuch perſons as hee ſhall appoint meete for that purpoſe: and ſhall take bonds of euery of them in good ſummes of money not vnder one hundred pound a piece to her Maieſties vſe, not to dreſſe any fleſh in their houſes this Lent time for any reſpect, except, it be for ſome ſuch perſon that lieth in their houſe, and that alſo hath licence through ſickeneſſe, or other neceſſarie cauſe, to eate fleſh. Bonds ſhall be taken alſo of the Poulters, not to vtter any Poultrie ware, but to ſuch as ſhall be like wiſe licenced to eate fleſh, and that ſuch as will not giue ſuch bonds, that they be ſecluded from all vtterance of victuall during the Lent ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>And for the Butchers and others that come with victuals of fleſh out of the Countrey the Citie, the L. Maior ſhall cauſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſons, whereof ſome to be named to the L. Maior by the Wardens of the Fiſhmongers, to watch at the gates and other like places in the Suburbes, where fleſh may be brought in, to view and ſearch, and to intercept the ſame. And in caſe the ſame ſhall be found to be brought to any perſon not warranted nor licenced to eate it, as is aforeſaid, then the ſame to be forfeited and ſolde at the diſcretion of the L. Maior, for the vſe of the poore in the Hoſpitals and priſons in the Citie, and the bringers to be impriſonned. And otherwiſe the Carriers of the ſaide victuals of fleſh to be guided to the perſons houſes that haue licence, with regard therein not to be abuſed, And this watch to be continued dayly during the whole time of Lent: and if any of theſe watch men be founde negligent and corupt in his charge, then he to be committed to priſon, there to continue during the whole Lent.</p>
            <p>And to the end the ſaid Orders may be duly executed, it is thought conuenient, that the L. Maior ſhould ſend for the chiefe Heads of the company of the Fiſhmongers, and ſhall cauſe them to make choiſe of foure or more wiſe and diſcreete perſons of the ſaide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and men of good wealth and habilitie, to whome they ſhall commit the charge to make enquirie after ſuch as ſhall be founde tranſgreſſors of the ſaide Orders: who in reſpect of their trauel beſtowed in that behalfe, ſhall haue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one moitie of ſuch bonds as ſhall be forfeited by tranſgreſſing of the ſaid Orders, and the other moitie to bee conuerted vnto godly vſes, by the diſcretion of the Queenes Maieſties High Almner, ſpecially vpon poore and lame ſouldiers, with the priuitie of ſome of the Priuie Councell.</p>
            <p>And that there may be due execution of the ſaid Orders, as well without as within the Liberties of the Citie, it is thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that they that haue the chiefe charge ouer the places priuileged and exempt, where any Leets or Law dayes are kept, ſhal authorize vnder their hand and ſeale foure perſons as are aboue mentioned, to make ſearch within the ſaide priuileged and exempt places for ſuch as ſhall tranſgreſſe the ſaid Orders, and ſhall for their trauell therein employed, receiue the moitie of the Bonds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, as is aboue mentioned. And for the auoyding of corruption and partialitie in the ſaid perſons, it ſhall be neceſſarie to take their othes, and giue bond in ſome good and large ſummes, to ſee (as much as in them lieth,) a due obſeruation of the ſaid Orders.</p>
            <p>And for that it is to be doubted, that the ſaid Fiſhmongers, vpon the obſeruation of the ſaid Orders, will take occaſion thereby to inhaunce the priſes, aſ well of Freſh as of Sea fiſh: It is thought meete, that the Lord Maior ſhall take order with the ſaid Fiſhmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that aſ well the Salt as Freſh fiſh ſhall vttered at reaſonable priſes.</p>
            <p>And it is ordered that no Butcher ſhall kill any Beeues, but ſuch as ſhall be ſpecially licenced thereunto, without any fraude, for the furniſhing of ſuch ſhippes as ſhall bee lawfully employed by Sea, either in the way of traffique, or otherwiſe. And that ſuch Butchers, as ſhall be licenced within the Liberties by the head officers of the Liberties of kill any fleſh, ſhall euery foureteene dayes at the leaſt, giue a true certificate vnto the Lord Maior and head officers of the places exempt, of ſuch numbers of Veales, Lambes, and Muttons, as ſhal be by them weekely killed: to the end, there may be a true certificate made euery fifteene dayes vnto the Lords and others of her Maieſties Priuie councell, what numbers of the ſeuerall kindes aboue mentioned ſhall be killed, either within the Citie, or places exempt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, where any Butchers ſhal be licenced in any exempt place without the Citie of London &amp; the Liberties thereof, before the ſaid Butchers ſhall be ſuffered to kill or ſell any Fleſh, they ſhall make payment to the hands of the officers that ſhall giue them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for the reliefe of maimed Souldiers, Mariners, and other lame and impotent perſons ſuch ſummes of money as ſhall be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by letters, either of the Priuie councell, or of the Lieutenant of the Shires.</p>
            <p>And as theſe Orders are expreſly deuiſed to be executed in the Citie of London, and places neere to the ſame, ſo her Maieſties pleaſure and commandement is, that the execution of theſe like Orders be performed by the commandement of her Maieſties Lieutenants to be ſent to the Juſtices of the peace, in all Shires within their rule, and to all other in Townes corporate, or in any Liberties, with like order for bonds to be taken to her Maieſties vſe: the benefit of the forfeiture of which bondes, her Maieſtie may at the interceſſion of the ſaid Lieutenants cauſe to be diſtributed amongſt lame and poore ſouldiers.</p>
