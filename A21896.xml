            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And for the better knowledge of the trueth of the≈øe di≈øorders, and redre≈ø≈øe of the inconueniencess, the ≈øayd Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ≈øhall call before them, and ≈øend for any of the ≈øeruants of any Inholders, Victuallers, Tauernrrs, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of ordinarie tables, and ≈øuch other that utter victuals, to examine them vpon their corporall othes, what fle≈øh ≈øhall be, or is any day during the Lent ≈øea≈øon dre≈ø≈øed, killed, vttered, or eaten in their hou≈øes: which if they ≈øhall refu≈øe to doe, then they ≈øhall commit to pri≈øon the ≈øayd ≈øeruants, ≈øo refu≈øing vpon their othes to declare the trueth.</p>
            <p>And Becau≈øe a great part of this di≈øorder groweth by the Butchers of the Citie of London, and al≈øo of the Countrey, that ≈øecretly kill and bring fle≈øh to the Citie: there ≈øhall be onely ≈øixe Butchers licenced by the Lord Maior to kill fle≈øh within the ≈øayd Citie and liberties thereof, yeelding for the reliefe of maymed Souldiers and Mariners ≈øuch ≈øummes as ≈øhall he limitted for that purpo≈øe by order of the privie Coun≈øell.</p>
            <p>And euery of the≈øe Butchers to be ≈øo licenced, ≈øhall be fir≈øt bound in the ≈øumme of two hundreth poundes to her Maie≈øties v≈øe, (and the bonds to the certified to the Queenes Remembrancer in the Exchequer) to ≈øell no fle≈øh in the time of Lent, but to ≈øuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons as ≈øhall ≈øhew them ≈øpeciall warrant from the Lord Maior, vnder his hand, and that the Butchers doe truely keepe particular bookes of their dayly ≈øales, and of the names of tho≈øe to whome they ≈øhall ≈øo ≈øell, with the quantities and the times thereof.</p>
            <p>That the Lord Maior giue order to the≈øe Butchers, not to ≈øell any fle≈øh but at rea≈øonable prices, &amp; for that purpo≈øe the prices ≈øhall be ≈øet downe by the ≈øayd L.

            <p>That the Lord Maior him≈øelfe ≈øhall graunt no warrant for buying of fle≈øh in Lent, but to ≈øuch as ≈øhall haue and ≈øhewe to him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in good writing according to the lawes of the Realme to eate fle≈øh, and the ≈øaid licence to be viewed and regi≈øtred, fir≈øt by ≈øome two meete per≈øons to be appointed for this purpo≈øe by the Lorde Maior, and Bookes to be kept thereof, to be ≈øhewed further when the ≈øame ≈øhall be required, vnle≈ø≈øe it be to Amba≈ø≈øadors and Agents of forreine Princes, to whome notwith≈øtanding no further quantitie ≈øhall be allowed, then ratably for their owne hou≈øbold, and that ≈øuch Amba≈ø≈øadors and Agents ≈øhall giue to the Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior a Certificate weekely, what they ≈øhall require to be for their owne tables.</p>
            <p>That the L. Maior ≈øhall nowe pre≈øently before Lent cau≈øe all Inholders, Table keepers, Victualers, Alehou≈øekeepers, and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners within the Citie, and liberties thereof, to appeare before him, or ≈øuch per≈øons as hee ≈øhall appoint meete for that purpo≈øe: and ≈øhall take bonds of euery of them in good ≈øummes of money not vnder one hundred pound a piece to her Maie≈øties v≈øe, not to dre≈ø≈øe any fle≈øh in their hou≈øes this Lent time for any re≈øpect, except, it be for ≈øome ≈øuch per≈øon that lieth in their hou≈øe, and that al≈øo hath licence through ≈øickene≈ø≈øe, or other nece≈ø≈øarie cau≈øe, to eate fle≈øh. Bonds ≈øhall be taken al≈øo of the Poulters, not to vtter any Poultrie ware, but to ≈øuch as ≈øhall be like wi≈øe licenced to eate fle≈øh, and that ≈øuch as will not giue ≈øuch bonds, that they be ≈øecluded from all vtterance of victuall during the Lent ≈øea≈øon.</p>
            <p>And for the Butchers and others that come with victuals of fle≈øh out of the Countrey the Citie, the L. Maior ≈øhall cau≈øe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine per≈øons, whereof ≈øome to be named to the L. Maior by the Wardens of the Fi≈øhmongers, to watch at the gates and other like places in the Suburbes, where fle≈øh may be brought in, to view and ≈øearch, and to intercept the ≈øame. And in ca≈øe the ≈øame ≈øhall be found to be brought to any per≈øon not warranted nor licenced to eate it, as is afore≈øaid, then the ≈øame to be forfeited and ≈øolde at the di≈øcretion of the L. Maior, for the v≈øe of the poore in the Ho≈øpitals and pri≈øons in the Citie, and the bringers to be impri≈øonned. And otherwi≈øe the Carriers of the ≈øaide victuals of fle≈øh to be guided to the per≈øons hou≈øes that haue licence, with regard therein not to be abu≈øed, And this watch to be continued dayly during the whole time of Lent: and if any of the≈øe watch men be founde negligent and corupt in his charge, then he to be committed to pri≈øon, there to continue during the whole Lent.</p>
            <p>And to the end the ≈øaid Orders may be duly executed, it is thought conuenient, that the L. Maior ≈øhould ≈øend for the chiefe Heads of the company of the Fi≈øhmongers, and ≈øhall cau≈øe them to make choi≈øe of foure or more wi≈øe and di≈øcreete per≈øons of the ≈øaide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and men of good wealth and habilitie, to whome they ≈øhall commit the charge to make enquirie after ≈øuch as ≈øhall be founde tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors of the ≈øaide Orders: who in re≈øpect of their trauel be≈øtowed in that behalfe, ≈øhall haue y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> one moitie of ≈øuch bonds as ≈øhall be forfeited by tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing of the ≈øaid Orders, and the other moitie to bee conuerted vnto godly v≈øes, by the di≈øcretion of the Queenes Maie≈øties High Almner, ≈øpecially vpon poore and lame ≈øouldiers, with the priuitie of ≈øome of the Priuie Councell.</p>
            <p>And that there may be due execution of the ≈øaid Orders, as well without as within the Liberties of the Citie, it is thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that they that haue the chiefe charge ouer the places priuileged and exempt, where any Leets or Law dayes are kept, ≈øhal authorize vnder their hand and ≈øeale foure per≈øons as are aboue mentioned, to make ≈øearch within the ≈øaide priuileged and exempt places for ≈øuch as ≈øhall tran≈øgre≈ø≈øe the ≈øaid Orders, and ≈øhall for their trauell therein employed, receiue the moitie of the Bonds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, as is aboue mentioned. And for the auoyding of corruption and partialitie in the ≈øaid per≈øons, it ≈øhall be nece≈ø≈øarie to take their othes, and giue bond in ≈øome good and large ≈øummes, to ≈øee (as much as in them lieth,) a due ob≈øeruation of the ≈øaid Orders.</p>
            <p>And for that it is to be doubted, that the ≈øaid Fi≈øhmongers, vpon the ob≈øeruation of the ≈øaid Orders, will take occa≈øion thereby to inhaunce the pri≈øes, a≈ø well of Fre≈øh as of Sea fi≈øh: It is thought meete, that the Lord Maior ≈øhall take order with the ≈øaid Fi≈øhmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that a≈ø well the Salt as Fre≈øh fi≈øh ≈øhall vttered at rea≈øonable pri≈øes.</p>
            <p>And it is ordered that no Butcher ≈øhall kill any Beeues, but ≈øuch as ≈øhall be ≈øpecially licenced thereunto, without any fraude, for the furni≈øhing of ≈øuch ≈øhippes as ≈øhall bee lawfully employed by Sea, either in the way of traffique, or otherwi≈øe. And that ≈øuch Butchers, as ≈øhall be licenced within the Liberties by the head officers of the Liberties of kill any fle≈øh, ≈øhall euery foureteene dayes at the lea≈øt, giue a true certificate vnto the Lord Maior and head officers of the places exempt, of ≈øuch numbers of Veales, Lambes, and Muttons, as ≈øhal be by them weekely killed: to the end, there may be a true certificate made euery fifteene dayes vnto the Lords and others of her Maie≈øties Priuie councell, what numbers of the ≈øeuerall kindes aboue mentioned ≈øhall be killed, either within the Citie, or places exempt.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, where any Butchers ≈øhal be licenced in any exempt place without the Citie of London &amp; the Liberties thereof, before the ≈øaid Butchers ≈øhall be ≈øuffered to kill or ≈øell any Fle≈øh, they ≈øhall make payment to the hands of the officers that ≈øhall giue them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, for the reliefe of maimed Souldiers, Mariners, and other lame and impotent per≈øons ≈øuch ≈øummes of money as ≈øhall be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by letters, either of the Priuie councell, or of the Lieutenant of the Shires.</p>
            <p>And as the≈øe Orders are expre≈øly deui≈øed to be executed in the Citie of London, and places neere to the ≈øame, ≈øo her Maie≈øties plea≈øure and commandement is, that the execution of the≈øe like Orders be performed by the commandement of her Maie≈øties Lieutenants to be ≈øent to the Ju≈øtices of the peace, in all Shires within their rule, and to all other in Townes corporate, or in any Liberties, with like order for bonds to be taken to her Maie≈øties v≈øe: the benefit of the forfeiture of which bondes, her Maie≈øtie may at the interce≈ø≈øion of the ≈øaid Lieutenants cau≈øe to be di≈øtributed among≈øt lame and poore ≈øouldiers.</p>
